<h2>Listen Now to Discover:</h2>

<p>[01:18] - Brian welcomes his special guest <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosinhtx/">Carlos Nunez</a>, a DevOps consultant at <a href="https://www.vmware.com/cross-cloud-services.html?src=ps_s27fq4cvo1f7o&amp;cid=7012H000001hiWkQAI&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1aOpBhCOARIsACXYv-d-XzMepLs078BA5UxuhQbBaT6eyTcIK1XCRw7CEotoF5MZ2Y9uKRoaAlDLEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">VMWare</a>, to discuss DevOps and its relationship with Agile.<br />
[02:40] - Carlos introduces the concept of DevOps and the need for collaboration between development and operations and the importance of both sides understanding each other&#39;s work to improve communication and efficiency in software delivery.<br />
[03:36] - What DevOps is not. Brian and Carlos discuss the various aspects of development, testing, and deployment in software development.<br />
[04:25] &ndash; Carlos shares a common misapplication of DevOps.<br />
[05:35] - Fostering a culture of communication and collaboration rather than using technical knowledge to obstruct progress and create bottlenecks.<br />
[05:48] - Brian shares the core concept of DevOps with the agile mindset.<br />
[06:20] - Brian asks Carlos why DevOps was developed and what can be gained when teams advance their DevOps practices.<br />
[06:30] - Carlos discusses the origin of DevOps, (hint: it started at an Agile conference).<br />
[07:05] - How DevOps can enhance team operations by fostering better communication and collaboration between developers and operators.<br />
[08:35] - The importance of looking at software and operating systems holistically.<br />
[09:54] - Brian expands on the importance of breaking down rigid skill boundaries to work more efficiently to enhance teamwork and results.<br />

[11:57] - Are Scrum Masters still effective?<br />
[12:49] - Brian delves into the relationship between DevOps and Agile, addressing occasional pushback from DevOps practitioners who claim that DevOps and Agile don&#39;t work well together.<br />
[13:16] - Carlos shares insights from <a href="https://assets.swoogo.com/uploads/2764046-64bee2130df92.pdf">his talk</a>, where he explored criticisms of Agile from DevOps practitioners, where some of the criticism originates from and his thoughts on the negative perception.<br />
[15:15] - Are you thinking about getting certified as a Scrub Master?

[19:20] - How test-driven development (TDD) forms a bridge between developers and operators, allowing both to understand how to write tests, get them to pass, and refactor&mdash;like the developer&#39;s "red, green, refactor" process.<br />
[20:25] - Carlos discusses Jira, a widely recognized (and polarizing) Agile tool, and the two reasons he prefers it.<br />

          <![CDATA[<p>Today, Brian sits down with Mike Cohn, the CEO of Mountain Goat Software to talk about how leaders can use agile concepts in order to keep their team operating at its best. </p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Today, on the <em>Agile Mentors Podcast</em>, Brian sits down with Mike Cohn, the CEO of Mountain Goat Software to discuss the role of a leader role in Agile.</p>

<p>Listen in as Mike and Brian share their combined years of knowledge to help leaders use agile concepts to avoid the pitfalls of becoming a manager &ldquo;behaving badly.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Listen Now to Discover:</h2>

<p>[01:08] - Brian introduces the show and his special guest <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/meet-the-team/mike-cohn">Mike Cohn</a> here to talk about the role of a leader in the Agile space.<br />
[01:53] - "Don&#39;t command, create a culture." Mike shares the difference between Agile leaders and traditional leadership.<br />
[02:59] - The concern about a resurgence of &lsquo;old-school&rsquo; leadership and the concerns that brings.<br />
[04:48] - Mike shares how leaders can use agile concepts like self-organization, setting goals, choosing team members, and defining constraints in order to keep the team operating at its best. (Resource: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Problems-Righteous-Solutions-Engineering/dp/013590126X"><em>Wicked Problems, Righteous Solutions: A Catologue of Modern Engineering Paradigms</em></a>).<br />
[06:26] - Brian shares options for management to allow teams to figure out how to address problems as a team.<br />
[08:23] - Trust but verify isn&#39;t ideal&mdash;Mike shares why it&rsquo;s better to manage by exception, i.e. giving trust upfront and asking questions later.<br />
[11:18] - Did you know the<a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/podcast"><em> Agile Mentors Podcast</em></a> is brought to you by <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/">Mountain Goat Software</a>? Whether you&#39;re looking to get <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/training/courses/certified-scrummaster">Certified Scrum Master Training</a> or would like &#8203;&#8203;<a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/training/courses/advanced-certified-scrum-product-owner">Advanced Certified Scrum Product Owner&reg;</a> training, Mountain Goat has plenty of options.

[12:01] - Delving into the complexity of the relationship between leadership and employees, especially when it comes to trust, self-organization, and planning.<br />
[12:48] - Mike introduces the &ldquo;Cone of Uncertainty&rdquo; concept, sharing that having a plan is not a problem over any horizon, (over three days, three months, or three years) but managers need to accept that the level of precision in the plan should match the timeframe.<br />
[14:23] - Mike refers to an article from <a href="https://hbr.org/"><em>Harvard Business Review</em></a> that highlights the difference in scrutiny between product development deadlines and sales projections, and the need for a more balanced and flexible approach in evaluating both areas.<br />
[16:05] - Language and terminology shape our perception&mdash;how the shift from "estimating" to "forecasting" helps facilitate the recognition of uncertainty in future predictions.<br />
[19:12] - Mike shares an anecdote about a client in Kansas City, who wanted him to use the word "forecast" instead of "estimate."<br />
[20:31] - The importance of assessing metric application in a leadership context.<br />
[21:06] - Mike highlights the danger of using "velocity" as a metric for team performance, explaining how subtle pressure on teams can lead to estimate inflation, rendering velocity less reliable for forecasting and more as a tool to pressure (and demotivate) teams.<br />
[24:12] - Brian encourages leaders to reflect on the motivation behind using things like velocity as a metric to measure teams and how this relates to the principles of self-organization in Agile.<br />
[25:22] - How a lack of proper training during role transitions can lead to managers &lsquo;behaving badly,&rsquo; despite well-intentioned actions.<br />

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>Join us on the Agile Mentors Podcast as Brian unveils the secrets to resolving conflicts to achieve win-win outcomes in your Agile teams. </p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Whether you&#39;re a Scrum Master, Product Owner, or an Agile coach, conflicts are inevitable and can become messy if not navigated successfully.</p>

<p>Today, on the <em>Agile Mentors Podcast</em>, <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/meet-the-team/brian-milner">Brian</a> guides us through various conflict types and shares techniques for effectively managing and resolving team conflicts. These methods encompass the Thomas-Kilmann Instrument (TKI) framework, facilitative listening, and the use of team agreements to validate differences, ensuring that everyone feels safe and acknowledged, creating win-win solutions for all involved.</p>

<h2>Listen Now to Discover:</h2>

<p>[02:29] - How we handle conflict on our teams.<br />
[02:55] - Conflict is necessary for teams to challenge each other and make better decisions (Chernobyl disaster example).<br />
[04:38] - Conflict is inevitable and can take various forms, including messy and sticky situations that are not always desirable.<br />
[04:56] - Brian shares a past conflict management failure when as a Scrum Master, he inadequately handled a conflict between two team members, leading to a breakdown in communication and a loss of mutual respect.<br />
[09:15] - The need for Scrum Masters to develop corporate counselor skills, such as emotional intelligence and empathy, to effectively counsel and navigate conflicts within teams.<br />
[10:44] - Rational vs. Emotional conflict and the importance of shifting the focus back to the rational side for productive conflict resolution.<br />
[12:15] - Brian shares the difference between constructive and destructive conflict and the signs of each.<br />
[13:34] - The three types of conflicts in a team: task, relationship, and process conflicts and why it&rsquo;s vital to understand the differences between these types of conflicts in order to navigate them effectively.<br />
[16:20] - <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/">Mountain Goat Software</a> has designed our <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/training/courses/certified-scrummaster">Scrum Certification classes</a> to combine the best learning with the best engagement. If you want to see it in action, check out our <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/training">training pages</a> at <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/">Mountain Goat Software</a> today.<br />
[17:22] - Each person has a default way of responding to conflict. You can identify your own response style using the <a href="https://kilmanndiagnostics.com/overview-thomas-kilmann-conflict-mode-instrument-tki/">Thomas-Kilmann Instrument (TKI)</a> framework which divides responses into five categories: competing, collaborating, compromising, avoiding, and accommodating.<br />
[18:32] - Competing involves prioritizing one&#39;s own position but it can be justifiable in certain situations.<br />
[19:55] - Collaborating aims for win-win solutions through creative problem-solving, especially in scenarios with conflicting preferences.<br />
[21:01] - The third C offers an acceptable solution that satisfies both individual&#39;s concerns.<br />
[21:34] - Avoiding, marked by its unassertive and uncooperative nature, ultimately striving to sweep the conflict under the rug.<br />
[22;42] - Accommodating prioritizes the relationship above all else, willingly setting aside one&#39;s own stance to adopt the opposing point of view.<br />
[23:40] - Your default conflict resolution approach isn&#39;t necessarily bad; it can be effective in certain situations. Brian offers tips for recognizing and responding to these approaches in conflict situations.<br />
[25:08] - Psychological safety in a team is vital for healthy conflict resolution. Brian explains what that means and how to build it within your team.<br />
[28:10] - How team agreements can help prevent conflicts from turning destructive.<br />
[28:40] - Putting ground rules in place on your team so that when conflict occurs, you can navigate it successfully.<br />
[30:42] - Facilitative listening helps address problems without attacking personalities. Brian shares his techniques to assist others in hearing. Legitimizing differences by acknowledging and validating opposing viewpoints can help resolve conflicts within a team.<br />
[32:29] - Overlooking human dynamics can lead to team failure but legitimizing differences helps everyone feel safe and heard.<br />

<h3>Reasons for Quick MVP in Data Science are to support:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Iterative Development</li>
	<li>Feedback Loop</li>
	<li>Risk Mitigation</li>
	<li>Setting Expectations</li>
	<li>Operational Considerations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps of the MVP:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Problem Definition</li>
	<li>Gather and Preprocess the Data</li>
	<li>Select a simple model</li>
	<li>Feature engineering</li>
	<li>Train the model</li>
	<li>Evaluate the model</li>
	<li>Deploy the MVP</li>
	<li>Collect Feedback</li>
	<li>Iterate</li>
	<li>Decision Time</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples of MVP in Data Science</strong> (Logistic regression and decision trees are often used as initial models due to their simplicity, interpretability, and relatively quick development time.)</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> Instead of building a complex recommendation engine, a company might start with a simple rule-based system (e.g., recommending the most popular items) to gauge user interest and system engagement.</li>
	<li><strong>Churn Prediction:</strong> An MVP might involve creating a basic model based on a few key features (like usage frequency and customer complaints) to predict which customers might churn. Later versions can incorporate more nuanced data and sophisticated algorithms.</li>
	<li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> For a chatbot, the MVP might involve scripted responses or basic keyword matching. Once deployed, user interactions can inform the development of more advanced NLP capabilities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>With Rapid MVP, context is crucial with regard to our general benchmarks (F1-Score, ROC-AUC, MAE, RMSE). You should strive to always consider the context of those benchmarks with the problem being solved. In some medical diagnostic tests, even an F1-score of 0.95 might not be good enough due to the severe consequences of false negatives or false positives. We also likely need to compare the model&#39;s performance metrics with a simple baseline (e.g., random classifier, mean prediction) to determine how much value the model is adding. Always align the model&#39;s performance with business objectives. Even a model with a high ROC-AUC might not be suitable if it doesn&#39;t meet the specific precision or recall targets set by the business. Isn&rsquo;t it better to find ways to know that earlier than later?</p>

        <link>https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/podcast/60-breaking-the-agile-deja-vu-tackling-recurring-anti-patterns-with-reese-schmit</link>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Agile Mentors Podcast, Brian welcomes Agile coach Reese Schmit who shares her tips for breaking recurring anti-patterns in teams and organizations through the power of the why.</p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In this episode of the Agile Mentors Podcast, Brian is joined by Agile Coach <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/reeseschmit/">Reese Schmit</a> to discuss identifying and tackling recurring Agile anti-patterns in teams and organizations. Reese shares her valuable insights on the significance of understanding the "why" behind Agile practice and avoiding the trap of "cargo cult Scrum." Listen in as she shares her tips for fostering transparency, collaboration, and trust among team members and how rediscovering the purpose behind Agile practices can lead to a world where people are excited and happy about their work.</p>

<h2>Listen Now to Discover:</h2>

<p>[01:10] - Brian sits down with guest <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reeseschmit/">Reese Schmit</a>, a coach, trainer, and mom, from the <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile2023/">Agile 2023 Conference in Orlando</a>, to discuss identifying and tackling recurring Agile anti-patterns in teams and organizations.<br />
[03:10] - Reese talks about her revelation during an open jam session at the Agile 2023 Conference, where she realized the prevalence of the same anti-patterns across different teams and organizations over the past 15 years.<br />
[05:04] - Brian and Reese discuss the frustratingly common situation of organizations claiming uniqueness but facing the same Agile challenges.<br />
[06:19] - Reese highlights the misguided approach of blindly adhering to Agile frameworks like Scrum without understanding the principles.<br />
[06:38] - Overplanning and white-knuckling the backlog = irrelevant user stories and wasted efforts.<br />
[07:25] - Reese shares her journey as a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) and her initial motivation to uncover the reasons behind the persistent issues in Agile implementations.<br />
[08:54] - Brian uses the analogy of a road trip to bring home the concept of why teams need a clear goal to keep them engaged and aligned with the Agile transformation rather than just imposing Agile practices on them.

[12:28] - Brian references <a href="https://www.danpink.com/">Dan Pink&#39;s</a> ideas on <a href="https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/">autonomy, mastery, and purpose</a>, about the importance of understanding the "why" and measuring progress.<br />

[23:37] - Brian shares how presumptive fixes can lead to misunderstandings and reduced trust.<br />
[25:46] - Recognize that team members are capable and intelligent professionals to foster trust and collaboration.<br />
[26:58] - Reese emphasizes the need to help organizations acknowledge when their information or assumptions are wrong.<br />

[31:48] - Avoid pointless meetings.<br />

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Agile Mentors Podcast, Brian welcomes Don McGreal to discuss the revision of the Scrum Guide and the delicate balance between staying true to the core principles of Scrum while allowing for necessary flexibility.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In this episode of the Agile Mentors Podcast, Brian is joined by <a href="https://improving.com/profile/don-mcgreal/">Don McGreal</a>, to delve into the topic of revising the <a href="https://scrumguides.org/index.html">Scrum Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Don shares some of the behind-the-scenes of the decision-making process, and the rationale behind the crucial revisions that have shaped the latest version of the Scrum Guide.</p>

<p>Listen in to gain a deeper understanding of the principles that guide Scrum and how they continue to evolve and the delicate balance between staying true to the core principles while allowing for necessary flexibility.</p>

<h2>Listen Now to Discover:</h2>

<p>[01:11] - Brian welcomes us to the show and introduces his guest, <a href="https://improving.com/profile/don-mcgreal/">Don McGreal</a>, the Founder and Vice President of Learning Solutions for <a href="https://improving.com/">Improving</a>, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Product-Owner-Leveraging-Competitive/dp/0134686470"><em>&ldquo;The Professional Product Owner&rdquo;</em></a> and a big name in the <a href="https://www.scrum.org/">Scrum.org</a> community to talk about revising the <a href="https://scrumguides.org/index.html">Scrum Guide</a>.<br />
[04:27] - Don shares how he got involved in revising the Scrum Guide.<br />
[05:21] - One team, one group focused on the product.<br />
[06:57] - What a scrum team consists of now and why they made the change.<br />
[08:11]- We don&#39;t expect you to have a title on your business card.<br />
[08:53] -The switch from role to accountability.<br />
[10:51] - Ten people on a team, one Scrum master, one product owner: It&#39;s not illegal in Scrum to take on more than one set of accountabilities or have a bigger team but there are risks involved.<br />
[12:51] - Three people using Scrum to work through treatments for a child with autism.<br />
[13:34] - Why the team decided to stick with the term "developer."<br />
[16:22] - Other terms, including "sprint" and &#39;backlog" that caused debates and why they stuck.<br />
[17:39] - Scrum sounds different because it IS.<br />
[18:20] - True Leader: the hot-button topic in the scrum guide that people are still debating, and how they landed on their decision.<br />
[19:52] - Clarifying the term "serve" and the need for true leaders who empower the team and make things happen beyond just serving.<br />
[21:21] - Today&rsquo;s show is brought to you by <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/">Mountain Goat Software&#39;s</a>, <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/training/courses/advanced-certified-scrum-product-owner">Advanced Certified Product Owner&reg; Course</a>, which aims to enhance product owners&#39; skills, confidence, and credibility. The course offers lifetime access to materials and interactive software for valuable and enjoyable breakout exercises. Additionally, participants gain access to Mike Cohn&#39;s <a href="https://learn.agilementors.com/agile-mentors/">Agile Mentors Community</a>, with 12 months of ongoing coaching and support.<br />
[22:00] - The decision to drop the three questions from the Daily and the new approach.<br />
[22:47] - A significant addition to the Scrum framework &ndash; the concept of a product goal representing the journey towards a vision.<br />
[23:40] - The (results-driven) power of the product goal as inspired by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disciplines-Execution-Revised-Achieving-Important/dp/1982156988/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1690392916&amp;sr=8-1"><em>&ldquo;The 4 Disciplines of Execution."</em></a> and how it&rsquo;s changed how backlogs are managed and success is measured.<br />
[25:00] - Changing the measure of success: measuring success by value rather than checking things off a backlog list.<br />
[25:26] - The vision is the big idea-the product goal is the milestone. It&#39;s a step towards the vision.<br />
[26:21] - In the revised Scrum Guide, the product goal is now part of the product backlog, emphasizing a commitment to achieving objectives with sprint and product goals focusing on the overall goal, not every task, while the Definition of Done ensures the increment&#39;s success.<br />
[29:28] - Before the new Scrum Guide, teams working on multiple products had debates on having one prioritized backlog or multiple lists.<br />
[30:12] - How the introduction of the product goal in the Scrum Guide directed teams towards having one focused direction, (preventing everything from being equally important).<br />
[31:06] - How emphasizing one strategic focus helped teams with multiple products alleviate challenges with prioritizing and improved their approach and alignment.<br />
[31:43] - Product backlog with mixed products lacks direction. Product goal provides focus without excluding other items.<br />
[33:15] - Some of the controversial changes, like making refinement an event and concerns about terminology like "master" in Scrum roles.<br />
[34:49] - The term "immutable" in the Scrum Guide means unchanging, which some find bothersome, but it serves to maintain consistency and distinguish genuine Scrum from modified versions.<br />
[36:49] - It&#39;s immutable, and it isn&#39;t suffocating. It&#39;s a lightweight framework described in a 13-page document&mdash;there&#39;s a lot of wiggle room in there&mdash;give it a shot and give it its best chance to succeed by following these simple rules.<br />
[37:28] - Change it if you must but then stop calling it Scrum.<br />
[38:05] - The sacred text about Scrum is meant to be easy to take on, helpful&hellip;AND flexible.<br />
[39:22] - Learning from the early days: streamlining a 200-300 page document with legal complexities into the current <a href="https://scrumguides.org/index.html">Scrum Guide</a>, while aiming to distill its essence and promote simplicity and accessibility.<br />
[40:48] - You can find out more about Don and <a href="https://improving.com/">Improving</a> by visiting their <a href="https://improving.com/">website</a>. Additionally, Don&#39;s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Product-Owner-Leveraging-Competitive/dp/0134686470"><em>"The Professional Product Owner,"</em></a> can be found on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Product-Owner-Leveraging-Competitive/dp/0134686470">Amazon</a>.<br />

<p>Listen in to learn how to strike the right balance between technical knowledge and product ownership and why culture is crucial in successful Agile implementation within the data science domain.</p>

<h2>Listen Now to Discover:</h2>

<p>[01:16] - Brian introduces his guest Lance Dacy, referring to him as "our San Diego Zoo guy" and the topic of today&#39;s show using Agile or Scrum practices in a data science world.<br />
[02:27] - Lance shares his background in data science and how it fits into the world of Agile.<br />
[05:06] - The big reason so many people are against using Agile for data science and where the big rub is.<br />
[09:02] - Who cares if it&rsquo;s Agile or not? Lance shares Jeff Salts&#39;s <a href="https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-still-most-popular/">poll about data science</a> and introduces <a href="https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/">CRISP-DM</a>.<br />
[11:05] - The <a href="https://www.datascience-pm.com/crisp-dm-2/">six steps of the cross-industry standard process for data mining</a>.<br />
[14:18] - Adopting a Scrum-like approach and treating data science work as smaller phases makes it possible to classify and organize tasks effectively.<br />
[15:59] - Does anyone remember the Rational Unified Process?<br />
[17:57] - It&rsquo;s up to you to come up with ideas&mdash;once you have them, here&#39;s how we get it done.<br />
[18:18]&nbsp;- In the world of data science, implementing frameworks like Scrum can lead to misconceptions and failures&mdash;the key lies in understanding the layers of data science, navigating the complexities of the work effectively, and making informed decisions.<br />
[23:06] - The vital importance of feedback.<br />
[23:45] - The stages of the <a href="https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/en_us/doc/factsheet/sas-enterprise-miner-101369.pdf">SAS Enterprise Miner initiative</a>.<br />

[30:47] - When it comes to the role of a product owner, the technical knowledge required depends on the nature of the product.<br />
[31:42] - While Scrum lacks explicit guidance on backlog construction, the <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-work-through-a-problem-like-a-data-scientist/">OSEMN</a> framework themes (obtain, scrub, explore, model, interpret) can be incorporated to align sprint goals with specific aspects of the data science process.<br />
[33:47] - The framework or the structure of how you carry it out is less important than the kind of agreement.<br />

[36:37] - A fundamental misunderstanding about daily scrums.<br />
[37:18] - None of us are smarter than all of us together. Agile and Scrum work well when you know how to solve the problem, and there&#39;s a relatively clear path to victory.<br />

[39:28] - &ldquo;Data science is just the work that we&#39;re trying to do, tailor your process for your team and your culture and always inspect and adapt to try to make it better.&rdquo;<br />

<p>They&#39;ll walk listeners through the transformative power of external perspectives, navigating conflicts, and the collaborative mindset that fosters meaningful change.

[02:17] - Lucy shares her initial misconception about agile coaches and how it shaped her perception of their role.<br />
[03:02] - Brian relates his experience with the term "Agile Coach" and his revelation when delving into the subject.<br />
[04:16] - Lucy and Brian reflect on their transitions from exceptional Scrum Masters to agile coaching roles.<br />
[05:53] - The pros, cons, and trade-offs of transitioning from a Scrum Master to an Agile coach.<br />
[06:32] - The shift in focus that comes with Agile coaching and what to consider to determine if this change aligns with your preferences and career aspirations.<br />

[07:51] -How your role as a coach involves assisting your team and organization in their pursuit of progress (or debunking the myth of perfection in Agile).<br />
[08:11] - An Agile coach is NOT merely an elevated Scrum Master.<br />
[08:33] - The two opposing misconceptions about Agile coaching and the multifaceted aspects of coaching by <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/podcast/42-the-importance-of-self-mastery-with-bob-galen">Bob Galen</a>.<br />
[09:20] - Lucy emphasizes the importance of wearing multiple hats and the diverse skills required as an Agile coach.<br />

You can choose to define the problem, manage the process, or contribute to building the product&mdash;pick your door and start running (and if you don&#39;t like it, you can always switch).<br />
[29:06] Real knowledge comes from doing, BUT a class can get you started on the right foot to understanding how to do things and getting your hands dirty to cement further what you want to do.<br />

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>Join Brian and his guest Bob Payne as they discuss the principles of lean thinking and how they apply to Agile methodologies.</p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In this episode of the &ldquo;Agile Mentors&rdquo; Podcast, Brian sits down with <a href="https://lithespeed.com/team/bob-payne/">Bob Payne</a> to discuss the intersection of Agile and lean thinking. As an experienced Agile coach and host of the <a href="https://agiletoolkit.libsyn.com/">&ldquo;Agile Toolkit Podcast,&rdquo;</a> Bob shares his insights and offers practical tips for implementing lean thinking in your own team.</p>

<p>Listen in as they explore the fundamental principles of lean thinking in Agile methodologies. They discuss managing flow, not workers, and the importance of continuous improvement and experimentation to achieve sustainable, high-quality results in your organization and success in today&#39;s fast-paced business environment.</p>

<h2>Listen Now to Discover:</h2>

<p>[01:23] - Brian welcomes Bob Payne, the Senior Vice President of Training and Coaching at <a href="https://lithespeed.com/">Lithespeed</a>, as well as the host of the <a href="https://agiletoolkit.libsyn.com/"><em>&ldquo;Agile Toolkit Podcast&rdquo;</em></a> and the Chairman of the <a href="https://www.agiledc.org/">Agile DC Conference</a>. Bob is here to discuss lean systems and lean thinking.<br />
[03:57] - Bob explains how lean thinking is connected to Agile methods in knowledge work.<br />
[07:30] - Agile methods generate value through teamwork that ultimately ends up in the customer&#39;s hands, and lean thinking is the larger circle that encompasses these methods.<br />
[08:24] - Lean thinking involves discipline and continuous improvement, which are essential characteristics for any successful team.<br />
[10:30] - Lean thinking also considers the sustainability of the workforce&mdash;workers are seen as producing value, while management is there to create the system that makes them the most effective.<br />
[11:31] - Lean thinking provides inspiration for visual management systems (such as Kanban boards) to track work which is incredibly powerful (and were not invented by Agile methods).<br />
[11:47] - Lean didn&#39;t just appear out of thin air; it built off of multiple things.<br />
[12:17] - Lean principles are foundational, and empiricism is built into lean.<br />
[14:34] - Bob shares that visualizing work is crucial to managing it effectively and citing the example of Toyota&#39;s electronic boards.<br />
[15:52] - Managing the flow of work, not the workers. We aim for cross-functional, self-organizing teams in an Agile team to get the job done.<br />
[17:05] - Bob shares an analogy about the workflow in a coffee shop.<br />
[17:41] - Bob shares the lean thinking philosophy and discusses the use of on-demand planning and continuous improvement.<br />
[19:14] - Brian introduces the sponsor for the podcast, <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/">Mountain Goat Software</a>, which offers various training options for Agile methodologies. You can find their training schedule <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/training/schedule">here</a>.<br />
[19:46] - The difference between fixing the system and fixing the people in terms of leadership&mdash; Brian highlights the importance of a holistic view of the organizational structure to support the work and the workers in lean thinking.<br />
[20:36] - Brian shares the importance of limiting work in process within Scrum. He shares his experiences with XP teams and emphasizes the need to identify blockages and fix the source, not (just) the symptom.<br />
[23:03] - Bob and Brian discuss how Agile methods often miss local optimization, focusing on fixing bottlenecks instead of making other parts of the process more efficient.<br />
[25:23] - Bob shares how the focus on DevOps and better tooling has enabled Agile teams to go faster while maintaining safety (and avoiding burnout).<br />
[26:30] - Bob shares a talk called <a href="https://youtu.be/iG2YyXPeP2w">"Project to Product: Practical Realities at Large Scale Enterprises,&rdquo;</a> Kevin Fisher gave at a DevOps conference about an end-to-end value stream analysis.<br />
[27:40] - Bob discusses the need for a shift towards prioritizing rapid building and getting products to market, as Jeff Patton and Marty Cagan advocate.<br />
[28:37] - Bottlenecks? What the Scrum Master should focus on.<br />
[29:27] -Understanding the theory and philosophy behind Agile rather than just focusing on the practices is important. Brian shares why he believes it&#39;s crucial to recognize that the system needs to be fixed, not the worker.<br />
[30:49] - Understanding the theory and philosophy behind Agile methodologies rather than just focusing on the practices for more successful teams is essential.<br />
[31:18] - Bob talks about how teams should experiment with different ways of doing things and shares the early Agilists were making stuff up and pulling together ideas that worked. He spends the first hour and a half of his classes talking about the history and mindset of Agile and lays out these principles with case studies.<br />

          <![CDATA[<p>Join Brian and guest Scott Dunn as they share practical tips on navigating the challenges and achieving success in implementing Agile practices in regulatory environments on this episode of the "Agile Mentors" podcast. </p>

<h2>Overview:</h2>

<p>In this episode of the Agile Mentors podcast, Brian and Scott Dunn delve into the challenges of implementing Agile practices in regulatory environments. They discuss the importance of finding ways to work within regulatory frameworks, building trust with stakeholders, and adapting Agile principles to fit the unique needs of the organization. Listen in to discover practical strategies for navigating regulatory hurdles, effective communication with regulators and customers, and building a culture of continuous improvement in highly regulated industries.</p>

<h2>Listen Now to Discover:</h2>

<p>[01:30] - Brian welcomes<a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/sdunn"> Scott Dunn</a> to the Agile Mentors podcast. Scott is a Certified Enterprise Coach and Scrum Trainer with over 20 years of experience. Today&#39;s show is focused on the listener-inspired topic of implementing Agile in regulatory environments. (If you want to hear something specific, you can email us at <a href="mailto:podcast@mountaingoatsoftware.com">podcast@mountaingoatsoftware.com</a>).<br />
[02:31] - Change is hard. Sometimes you must dig deeper into the reasons for resistance, as it may not always be related to regulatory requirements.<br />
[03:09] - Scott shares his experience working in a compliance-heavy environment, noting that the people responsible for compliance may not always fully understand the regulations.<br />
[04:16] - Scott emphasizes the importance of researching the regulations independently. In his experience, mindset and willingness are key factors in successfully implementing Agile in regulatory environments.<br />
[06:05] - Brian shares an anecdote about a pushback he received in a private class about whether Agile principles would work in the real world.<br />
[07:59] - Scott shares a recent experience on a call with a Prime contractor for the government, where they discussed the government&#39;s modernization efforts and their shift towards agile methodologies. He also mentions the GSA&#39;s internal agile group, which requires funding recipients to adopt agile practices.<br />
[09:19] - The issue of government contracts requiring specific roles rather than generalists and how this can limit the implementation of agile practices.<br />
[10:20] - Scott discusses how contracts in government organizations can limit the ability to fully implement Agile principles and how to create change within their organizations.<br />
[11:33] - Brian discusses the idea that a transformation is an ongoing process and not something that can be checked off as completed. He talks about the importance of continual learning.<br />
[12:01] - Brian introduces the podcast sponsor, <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/training/courses/advanced-certified-scrum-product-owner">Mountain Good Software&#39;s Advanced Certified Product Owner course</a>. He explains how the course can help product owners increase their confidence, credibility, and value.<br />
[12:39] - The importance of collaboration over contract negotiation: Brian shares a story about <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/msahota">Michael Sahota</a>, who worked with the Canadian government on a bidding contract and revolutionized the government&#39;s fixed bid system.<br />
[15:07] - Brian explains that while regulatory environments require more documentation, examining whether certain documentation is necessary is essential.<br />
[15:54] - The need for empathy and understanding when working with regulatory environments.<br />
[16:26] - Small nudges = Significant change.<br />
[19:45] - The challenge of testing in regulatory environments, particularly regarding validation. Brian shares a story about a client with FAA regulations and how they tackled the issue, emphasizing the importance of collaboration.<br />
[23:20] - Scott suggests a pragmatic approach to achieving work goals, acknowledging the external constraints that may prevent perfection.<br />
[24:09] - Scott further explains that in some cases, there may be a sliding scale of achieving different levels of agility. Even small incremental steps towards agile implementation can provide benefits.<br />
[25:37] - Brian shares what he considers the #1 win in implementing Agile into these types of environments.<br />
[26:57] - What&#39;s possible? If you fast forward a year from now, what could be done now that gets us to the next step?<br />
[28:10] - Think about how you are showing up: the importance of facilitating idea-generating conversations and the type of leadership it takes to start those conversations and helps make the right thing happen. [29:30] - Scott and Brian discuss the quote, "if you&#39;re the smartest person in the room, you&#39;re in the wrong room," and how important it is to be around people who can push you and help you grow.<br />

        <link>https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/podcast/44-transformations-take-people-with-anu-smalley</link>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the &ldquo;Agile Mentors&rdquo; podcast, Brian and Anu Smalley share their perspectives on the relationship between culture and Agile transformation and why people are key.</p>


<p>Overview</p>

<p>Coaching an Agile transformation requires more than just knowing how to run a daily Scrum. Finding the right people for the job is critical to success.</p>

<p>In this episode of the "Agile Mentors" podcast, Brian and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anusmalley/">Anu Smalley</a> chat about the importance of diversity in Agile teams.</p>

<p>Listen in as Brian and Anu explore how culture impacts an organization&#39;s ability to adopt Agile practices, the role of leaders in creating an inclusive culture, and the power of sharing stories in building a strong community.</p>

<h2>Listen Now to Discover:</h2>

<p>[01:17] - Brian introduces us to the guest, Anu Smalley, who has a lot of experience in Agile coaching and consulting. She&rsquo;s also been instrumental in increasing diversity in the Agile community. She has a CST mentoring group for people who don&#39;t have the same background as the majority of people in the <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/">Scrum Alliance</a>. Her company is <a href="https://www.capalaconsulting.com/">Capala Consulting Group</a>.<br />
[03:34] - Metrics and methodologies are important in organizational transformation, but people are at the heart of it. Organizations cannot successfully transform without the right people.<br />
[04:02] - Anu talks about how the <a href="http://www.agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> emphasizes individuals and interactions as the key to success in transformation. She emphasizes the importance of having the right people in an organization to ensure a successful transformation.<br />
[05:07] - Coaching an Agile transformation requires more than just knowing how to run a daily Scrum. Finding the right people for the job is critical to success.<br />
[05:55] - Brian notes that some businesses see their employees as replaceable parts in a machine. A diversity of perspectives is essential; having only one perspective limits the team&#39;s potential.<br />
[06:52] - Each person is unique and cannot be replaced like a part in a machine. Anu stresses the importance of recognizing the human aspect of transformation to succeed and that metrics alone will not suffice.<br />
[07:48] - Brian discusses the comparison between Agile software development and research and development. Having the right people for the job is critical. [08:30] - Agile transformation requires a focus on people and coaching, and the framework will fall into place once that focus is in place.<br />
[09:14] - Anu highlights the importance of understanding what being Agile truly means rather than just knowing the techniques.<br />
[09:59] - Brian notes that while many attendees may attend Agile training classes solely for certification, trainers can use this opportunity to teach attendees a deeper understanding of Agile and transform their approach to work.<br />
[10:46] - Anu notes that there is a significant difference between implementing Scrum and transforming an organization&mdash;one can be learned in a two-day class, while the other requires a deeper understanding of what being Agile truly means.<br />
[12:02] - Focusing on people is the key to success in Agile transformation; without it, organizations will not get very far.<br />
[14:17] - Brian emphasizes the uniqueness of organizations and how Scrum is designed to be adjusted and custom fit for each group that uses it.<br />
[14:49] - Anu highlights the importance of role clarity for individuals and teams to minimize conflicts.<br />
[15:53] - The virtual world has made role clarity even more important. Anu shares an example of a client whose main focus for 2023 is to achieve role clarity amongst their teams, explaining what is essential to achieving this goal.<br />
[16:19] - Clarity is achieved by bringing people together, resolving conflicts, and working towards common goals.<br />
[16:19] - Anu emphasizes that coaching and resolving conflicts are key to achieving role clarity and smooth functioning among teams in an organization.<br />
[16:37] - Brian compares learning the basics of baseball to attending a class on Scrum&mdash;a class can teach you the basics&mdash;a coach is necessary to grow and improve.<br />
[17:50] - Anu shares that a coach is essential, even for the best sports people on the planet.<br />
[16:19] - Anu emphasizes the importance of role clarity and resolving conflicts in an organization to ensure everyone understands their role and works together effectively.<br />
[18:39] - Anu explains that the best players in any sport have personal coaches to keep them in the "being mode," focusing on the individual&#39;s growth to impact the company&#39;s growth.<br />
[19:33] - Brian highlights that even the best athletes in the world have coaches, and we should always keep growing and never stand still.<br />
[19:51] - Agile transformations are about the people we have&mdash;Anu reiterates the importance of focusing on individuals&#39; growth to impact the company&#39;s growth.<br />
[20:12] - Leaders need to ensure they have the right people and are continuously teaching, coaching, and helping them move forward.<br />
[20:35] - Brian introduces the sponsor of the podcast, <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/training/courses/certified-scrummaster">Mountain Goat Software&#39;s Certified ScrumMaster Class</a>, and highlights its benefits for those interested in understanding Scrum.<br />
[23:34] - Anu shares examples of clients who have decided to combine roles or accountabilities due to budget cuts and how it impacts the Agile journey.<br />
[24:40] - Anu advises against continuing the Agile journey until it can be done properly.<br />
[25:43] - Leaders often make the mistake of not understanding the importance of ScrumMasters, but ScrumMasters do, in fact, provide value (a little sarcasm here).<br />
[26:00] - Without capable ScrumMasters, the transformation will stall or fail.<br />
[26:39] - Brian notes that even with capable ScrumMasters, leaders must trust and empower them to drive the transformation forward.<br />
[27:02] - Culture is all about people; if you don&#39;t have a culture supporting Agile transformation, it won&#39;t go anywhere.<br />
[27:55] - Talking about trust issues between leadership and teams.<br />
[28:55] - Anu explains that some leaders may have talented staff, but they are too scared to trust them with an Agile transformation because they are worried about the culture and power structure changes.<br />
[29:35] - Brian suggests an innovation initiative, to which Anu sarcastically proposes an innovation sprint as a solution.<br />
[29:47] - Brian encourages listeners to contact Anu through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anusmalley/">LinkedIn</a> or through the website of her company, <a href="https://www.capalaconsulting.com/">Capala Consulting Group</a>.<br />
[30:52] - Anu invites listeners to share their Agile transformation stories with her and promotes the importance of building a community through shared experiences.<br />
[32:58] - The value of learning from different cultural perspectives.<br />
[33:17] - Brian invites you to share your ideas for the show or feedback. Email <a href="mailto:podcast@mountaingoatsoftware.com">Brian</a>.</p>

        <link>https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/podcast/43-cultivating-agile-team-culture-in-a-virtual-world-with-richard-cheng</link>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Agile Mentors podcast, Brian and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardcheng/">Richard Cheng</a> discuss the challenges of working in a virtual environment, sharing insights and strategies for maintaining team collaboration and communication. Listen in for practical tips and expert advice on navigating the changing landscape of remote work.</p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In this episode of the "<em>Agile Mentors</em>" podcast, Brian and Richard Cheng discuss the challenges and opportunities of the ever-evolving world of remote work in Agile teams and the role of technology in supporting Agile practices.</p>

<p>Listen in as they share their insights on the tools to use, how to maintain team cohesion and collaboration, and the importance of culture and personal connections. You&#39;ll find practical tips and inspiring ideas to help you navigate the virtual landscape and thrive in the new normal of work.</p>

<h2>Listen Now to Discover:</h2>

<p>[01:14] - Brian introduces Richard Cheng, founder of Agility Prime Solutions, trainer, teaching CSM, product owner, and combat classes. He is also working on a graphic novel about the adventures of a scrum master. He&#39;s here today to discuss the challenges of working.&zwnj;<br />
[04:16] - Richard highlights the significant shift towards virtual work that was already happening before the pandemic and the adoption of virtual work tools such as <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>, <a href="https://miro.com/">Miro</a>, and <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, which made the transition easier during the pandemic.<br />
[06:22] - Richard emphasizes the importance of using tools that foster better communication and collaboration rather than replacing them. The tools and policies around them should enable people to work better together rather than create more distance.<br />
[07:08] - Richard is relatively agnostic regarding specific tools, but he mentions that he is a huge fan of Zoom for instruction and prefers Miro or Mural for collaboration.<br />
[08:03] - Brian tends to use <a href="https://www.mural.co/">Mural</a> but also acknowledges the benefits of Miro (and shares a fun fact about Miro).<br />
[09:42] - Brian advises against letting the tool drive the collaboration process and instead focusing on conversations and collaboration first, then finding tools that enhance that process.<br />
[11:00] - Richard agrees with the idea that tools should not drive the team&#39;s workflow, but rather the team should drive the tools using the example of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira&trade;</a>. He advises teams to tailor their tools to support their evolving needs.<br />
[12:46] - Brian acknowledges the importance of standardization in big enterprises and advises teams to refer to items in their terms to better align with their workflow.<br />
[14:20] - Brian shares why tools that allow deep customization are enormously useful because you can implement a wealth of plugins.<br />
[15:01] - The key to keeping it simple&mdash;strip it down to the bare bones and then grow it. Richard shares an example from the best Agile shop he ever worked at, <a href="https://www.fool.com/">The Motley Fool</a>, and their tools, including <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>.<br />
[16:00] - Brian shares the sponsor for the podcast, <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/">Mountain Goat Software</a>, and the team home software they use for their <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/training">Agile and Scrum Training</a>.<br />
[18:39] - Richard discusses the virtual challenges of creating culture and teamwork, including communication, collaboration, and cross-functionality.<br />
[19:15] - The new frontier for companies: experimenting with different methods is essential while adapting methods to make them more effective.<br />
[20:46] - Richard discusses the issue with the Scrum guide&#39;s statement that Scrum is immutable, stating that once you&#39;re an expert, you should take what works and tweak what doesn&#39;t, drawing on an analogy about CrossFit, where workouts can be scaled up or down, and suggest that Scrum should be approached similarly.<br />
[23:48] - Promoting conversation and collaboration between teams, which is a big issue for many teams in the virtual world. Brian points out that time zone differences can be a problem. People on the other side of the globe must experiment more with asynchronous tools to communicate and collaborate effectively.<br />
[24:49] - Collaboration is less about geography and more about times. He promotes time zone friendliness to enable teams to collaborate more effectively and independently. Richard recommends setting up time zone-aligned value streams to improve product and service delivery speed, particularly for organizations with teams in multiple time zones.<br />
[26:25] - Brian emphasizes the importance of maintaining company culture in a virtual environment. He recommends virtual show-and-tell sessions to build a deeper connection among team members.<br />
[27:51] - Richard suggests that events such as <a href="https://shop.jackboxgames.com/products/the-jackbox-party-pack-pc-mac-linux-code?cq_src=google_ads&amp;cq_cmp=19778217596&amp;cq_con=&amp;cq_term=&amp;cq_med=&amp;cq_plac=&amp;cq_net=x&amp;cq_pos=&amp;cq_plt=gp&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwiOCgBhAgEiwAjv5whB0XTwlYtspRH0xgyTsfk1H0J_gRpFxH7ulNgitQzWJrfIVKASE5ZhoCrkYQAvD_BwE">game nights</a> and <a href="https://barandcocoa.com/pages/virtual-chocolate-tastings?gclid=CjwKCAjwiOCgBhAgEiwAjv5whNCe42_YYJgJda2cQNi1aPh6H1Wp8Qs2JK22tq02V7eI_SMM9ErjmRoC4y0QAvD_BwE">virtual chocolate tastings</a> can help bring teams and organizations closer together, even in a virtual environment. At the same time, optional in-person events for geographically connected teams can also be a good way to foster a sense of togetherness and culture.<br />
[29:15] - To help improve communication and strengthen the team&#39;s dynamics, create user manuals for team members: that includes their background, contributions to the team, and<br />
[30:37] - As a Scrum Master and Coach, being there and having osmotic communication was a big part of the job. Without it, we have to engineer everything, which can be challenging.<br />
[31:30] - Brian acknowledges that technology is rapidly changing but emphasizes the importance of not letting the tool drive the conversation. Instead, he suggests promoting collaboration and enabling teams to work better through policies and practices that bring the team together and rethink those that separate them.<br />

        <link>https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/podcast/41-cultural-transformation-in-organizations-with-karim-harbott</link>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>Karim Harbott joins Brian to talk about the 5 levers of crafting a strong culture in an organization and the critical role of leaders in establishing it. </p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>On this episode of the "Agile Mentors" podcast, Karim Harbott joins Brian to discuss the importance of crafting a strong culture in an organization through his 5 Levers for Changing Organizational Culture.</p>

<p>Listen in as they discuss the importance of aligning behaviors with the organization&#39;s strategy and the often-overlooked but critical role that leaders play in the cultural transformation of organizations.</p>

<h2>Listen Now to Discover:</h2>

<p>[01:34] - Brian introduces Karim Harbott, an Agile coach and CST, and highlights his book,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enablers-Business-Agility-Thrive-Uncertain/dp/1523090057"><em> &ldquo;The 6 Enablers of Business Agility&rdquo;</em></a> He&rsquo;s joining Brian to discuss culture change and the challenges associated with it.<br />
[02:25] - Karim discusses where to begin to make cultural change.<br />
[04:14] - Brian and Karim discuss the challenges of teaching culture and the importance of modeling desired behaviors.<br />
[04:47] - Karim explains that behaviors are a key factor in shaping culture and shares that there are five levers for changing the culture of an organization. The first lever is the organization&#39;s structure, which can encourage collaboration or silos and is the first thing within your control to influence behavior and how people collaborate.<br />
[07:15] - Karim emphasizes the importance of examining the system in place using the analogy of a gardener to explain that leaders need to create an environment that fosters the growth of the desired culture and behaviors.<br />
[07:51] - Brian references a quote by <a href="https://www.craiglarman.com/wiki/index.php?title=Books_by_Craig_Larman">Craig Larman</a> highlighting that whatever you&#39;re seeing at the moment, your system is designed to output that&mdash;for a different output, you gotta change the system.<br />
[08:21] - Karim explains that Craig Larman&#39;s and Deming&#39;s quote that "every system is perfectly designed for the results it&#39;s getting" both emphasize the importance of the structure in determining culture.<br />
[08:47] - Karin shares the second lever for changing culture, which is that the policies and rules that leaders create can be used to control or influence behaviors.<br />
[10:37] - Brian references the "Don&#39;t be evil" structure at Google and what it entailed.<br />
[11:37] - Karin discusses the importance of weaving high-level values into every part of how the organization operates, even the low-level aspects of the organization, to truly influence behaviors.<br />
[12:15] - Karin talks about the third lever of culture change, which is metrics and targets, and notes that what you measure and set as targets speaks volumes about what leadership values in the organization.<br />
[14:18] - Measuring intangible things like respect and integrity can be difficult, but it is important to find a way to measure them even though they don&rsquo;t fit neatly into a dashboard.<br />
[15:51] - Brian shares an interesting paradigm they use at Mountain Goat Software, where they set goals with both a visual and emotional aspect to help them determine when they&rsquo;ve reached their goal.<br />
[16:56] - Karim discusses the importance of HR processes as a lever (Lever #4) for influencing and reinforcing behaviors in an organization.<br />
[18:27] - Brian shares the sponsor for the podcast, <a href="https://learn.mountaingoatsoftware.com/bus-mike-live">Better User Stories</a>, a one-day live online training course with Mike Cohn to improve your user story writing, so your team can do its best work, faster.<br />
[19:12] Brian emphasizes the concept that the company is a team effort, not an individual sport.<br />
[20:21] Karim highlights the difference between Henry Ford&#39;s production line and a team-based environment using the analogy of chopping onions in the kitchen but being asked to make a tiramisu.<br />
[21:30] - If the culture incentivizes individuals to prioritize their own interests over the interests of the team, then there is a problem, and conflicting incentives will lead to failure.<br />
[22:21] - Incentivizing individualism over teamwork will lead to failure (and unhappiness among 70% of employees).<br />
[23:39] - Karim discusses the fifth lever, which he considers to be the most powerful: leadership behaviors.<br />
[26:20] - Actions speak louder than words: Brian speaks about the importance of leadership behavior in promoting a healthy work culture with the example of unlimited vacation policies.<br />
[28:23] - Karim talks about the importance of behavioral norms in an organization, citing descriptive and injunctive norms as examples. By using the example of a library, he illustrates how people tend to conform to social norms.<br />
[30:39] - Karim shares the two things that are necessary to strengthen a culture; without these, a culture cannot be strong (it&#39;s important for leaders to be hypersensitive to this).<br />
[31:47] - The disapproval of others can be a powerful tool to make sure people behave the way we want them to behave.<br />
[32:47] - Brian shares how the TV show <em>Brain Games</em> demonstrated social norms and people conforming to the crowd.<br />
[33:43] - Karim emphasizes the importance of crafting a strong culture as one of the most important things a leader can do and calls for it to be a core leadership capability.<br />
[35:46] - Do you have an idea for the show or feedback you&#39;d like to share? We&#39;d love to hear from you. Email <a href="mailto:podcast@mountaingoatsoftware.com">Brian</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Team Size
	<ul>
		<li>Tracking the size of our cross-functional team (typically Dev and QA), allows us to pair that number with velocity to play &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; scenarios in the future. Whether you count half of a person if shared, or whole, keeping it consistent throughout your tracking is what is important. Most teams simply count the number of developers and testers.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Team Days
	<ul>
		<li>Tracking the iteration length is also helpful in understanding a team&rsquo;s performance. If the team has a 2 week sprint, then usually that is 9 development days of actual work. The 10th day is set aside for sprint review, retrospective, and planning.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Committed
	<ul>
		<li>Tracking what the team committed to completing within a sprint is crucial to understanding their predictability. The are the most uneducated at the beginning of the sprint and tracking what they think they can complete helps us in long term planning.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Completed
	<ul>
		<li>Tracking what the team completed is actually just tracking velocity above, but comparing it what they committed helps us understand their predictability index.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Predictability Index (Pi)
	<ul>
		<li>Software development is complex, risky, and uncertain. A skill that is sought after in this type of environment is predictability. The better we are at understanding what we can accomplish, then finishing what we said we would accomplish builds trust with our management team and customers. If we aren&rsquo;t very good, tracking this metric often helps us get back to good by committing to less or more depending on our index.</li>
		<li>Example:
		<ul>
			<li>Completed Items / Committed Items = Predictability Index (Pi)</li>
			<li>25 Story Points / 20 Story Points = 125% 20 Story Points / 25 Story Points = 80%</li>
			<li>Just because a team has a high Pi, does not mean they are good at predictability. Don&rsquo;t let high and low numbers fool you, focus on the variance from 100% instead of the actual number. An arbitrary number to shoot for is +/- 15% Pi (85% or 115%).</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Story Points / Per Day (SPD)
	<ul>
		<li>Story points per day is just that, tracking how many story points per day of the sprint did we complete (Completed / Team Days).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Story Points / Per Day / Per Person (SP/PD/PP)
	<ul>
		<li>This perhaps is the most useful metric to capture throughout the process. Most of our teams do not have the luxury of maintaining a consistent size or make-up. Inevitably over the course of a few months, the team make-up will change. Once the teams change, velocity has to be reset.</li>
		<li>In addition, we may actually change our sprint duration over a long period of time (don&rsquo;t change it each sprint). Once we change sprint lengths, it can jeopardize our pure metrics, velocity has to be reset.</li>
		<li>However, over all of our teams in a product, if we can capture the SP/PD/PP that our teams complete on average, we can begin to play &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; scenarios in long- term planning.
		<ul>
			<li>Example:
			<ul>
				<li>Completed / (Team Size * Sprint Days)</li>
				<li>24 / (4 * 9) = 0.67</li>
				<li>You can then average that number over 4-6 sprints or even the year.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Defects
	<ul>
		<li>While we understand that we won&rsquo;t ever likely have a zero defect product, it is useful to track how many defects our teams are creating over time. There are usually 2 types of defects, internal and external.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Internal
	<ul>
		<li>Our definition of done should at minimum include that testing is taking place during the sprint with the idea that we would not allow a story to be called DONE if it had remaining defects. As such, an internal defect are the ones that were created while working on a backlog item in the sprint, that we have fixed before calling the item DONE.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>External
	<ul>
		<li>External defects are those that have &ldquo;escaped&rdquo; our development process and were not discovered during our testing. In a sense, our customer discovered the defect and the work item will become a new backlog item for a sprint.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Warranty
	<ul>
		<li>We should strive to have the warranty concept built into our process. If you bought a car yesterday and the radio fell out, you could take it back and they would fix it fairly quickly. Our customers deserve the same service. Don&rsquo;t manage a defect backlog, get used to fixing escaped defects immediately, while they are fresh on your mind (right after a sprint). It doesn&rsquo;t take a long time to fix defects, it takes a long time to find them once identified by a customer.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Defects per Story Point
	<ul>
		<li>Tracking defects per story point help to understand velocity a little better. If you have a team that has drastically increased its velocity, have the defects have increased along with it? Defects per story point help us understand the relationship between a velocity and defects created.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>[02:22] - Brian introduces Woody Zuill, a 40-year veteran software developer specializing in team interaction.<br />
[02:51] - Woody explains how he discovered the term Mob Programming.<br />
[04:56] - Where the idea of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Teaming-Organizations-Innovate-Compete-Knowledge/dp/078797093X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr="><em>Teaming</em></a> came from.<br />
[06:20] - Woody explains why he&#39;s changing the name from mob programming to teaming.<br />
[07:23] - Teaming = collaboration brought to software development, where more than one brain connects to do the work that needs to be done.<br />
[11:11] - Painting the Mob Programming picture: it&#39;s when "all the brilliant minds work together on the same thing &zwnj;in the same space, at the same computer."<br />
[13:40] - To work efficiently in software development, one team member acts as the driver at the keyboard while everyone else acts as the navigator.<br />
[16:41] - The drawbacks and disconnect of breaking software development down into smaller pieces.<br />
[18:34] - Isn&#39;t six people in one room working on one computer a waste of resources?<br />

[28:38] - Working together is often more effective, so why have we gotten better at it?<br />
[31:25] - The strength of experimentation.<br />
[33:09] - Woody explains that since the software development process is a discovery process, innovations such as mob programming can benefit the process.<br />

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>Henrik Kniberg joins Brian to talk about creating the Spotify Model. </p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>There are ways to get things done, and then there are the best ways to get things done. But the only way to arrive at the right way of doing things is to try and fail, to see what works and what doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/hkniberg">Henrik Kniberg</a> is a Certified Scrum Trainer who has worked with teams like Spotify and LEGO to help them implement agile culture in their fast-moving and fast-growing environments. He&#39;s also the co-creator of the <a href="https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1">Spotify Model</a>.</p>

<p>Today on the show, Henrik joins Brian to discuss his accidental introduction to Spotify and how he inspired the company to transition to Scrum. We discuss the leadership model that helped the startup scale while holding its own against behemoths like Apple and Google. Plus, an inside look at his time as a designer with Minecraft.</p>

<h2>Listen now to discover:</h2>

<p>[01:55] - Brian shares Henrik&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=502ILHjX9EE&amp;vl=en">Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell</a> that&#39;s become required viewing.<br />

[8:26] - Henrik describes how the lack of off-the-shelf scaling frameworks led to his work with Spotify.<br />
[08:45] - Standard Scrum, by the books, works for small teams, but for scaling at larger teams like the one at Spotify, it&#39;s hard to find a "one size fits all" approach.<br />
[10:59] - How realizing &#39;this is what&#39;s helping us swim&#39; during their impressive growth got all the technical leaders of Spotify on board with using Agile.<br />
[12:50] - Henrik shares the leadership model that helped Spotify scale up.<br />
[14:58] - How Spotify used the speed of innovation to stand against goliath-like competitors like Apple and Google.<br />

[21:36] - Henrik shares why leadership is the key to culture and driving change in an Agile organization.<br />
[24:19] - Brian shares why it&#39;s wise to make a change where you can benefit a company rather than hanging on to the now-extinct gold watch at retirement.<br />
[25:53] - "Go ahead and copy the Spotify model&hellip; and don&#39;t worry about someone telling you that you&#39;re doing it wrong because that&#39;s just you adapting."<br />

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>Brian speaks with Stacey Ackerman about working with Marketing teams using Agile. </p>

<p>While the majority of teams using Agile are based in software, one of the fastest growing areas for Scrum teams is in Marketing. There&rsquo;s a natural fit as Marketers are used to using such practices as A/B testing and getting quick results that feed their next steps.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, there are a unique set of challenges that a marketing team presents that other Scrum teams don&rsquo;t necessarily have to deal with as well. In this episode, Stacey talks us through the process that marketing teams follow when attempting to apply agile principles to their work.</p>

<h2>Listen now to discover:</h2>

<p>- 2:28 - what&rsquo;s different about the way marketing teams approach agile?<br />
- 8:51 - what is the Agile Marketing Navigator and how are teams using it?<br />
- 15:05 - Stacey goes over the different roles<br />
- 17:43 - what are the chief problems marketing teams deal with in adopting this?</p>

          <![CDATA[<p>Mike and Brian take audience questions in the &ldquo;best of&rdquo; from the Agile Mentors Community&rsquo;s monthly coaching calls.</p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Twice a month, there is an open Q&amp;A session we offer as part of the Agile Mentors Community where anyone from the community can join in and ask either Mike or Brian questions. These are open discussions and allow the users to ask their own questions that are unique to their situations. We call these &ldquo;Coaching Calls&rdquo; because they are there to help coach the members and help them overcome obstacles along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone who takes a class with Mountain Goat Software receives 12 months membership in the Agile Mentors Community and they are able to attend these calls and ask questions. Take a listen to some of the best questions we&rsquo;ve received over the past few months to get an idea of what these sessions are all about.</p>

<p>By the way, we are aware there are a few places where the audio is not perfect in this episode and apologize for the less-than-ideal audio in several places. This is because these answers come from live sessions and there were a few streaming hiccups while delivering them.</p>

        <link>https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/podcast/getting-there-from-here-agile-transformations</link>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>David Hawks joins Brian to discuss the process of an organization becoming Agile.</p>


<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When you read through the Scrum Guide, the picture it paints is of the desired end result - what the team/organization should look like when finished. There&rsquo;s surprising little said though about how you get from where you are to where you want to eventually be. Enter the topic of Agile Transformations.

In this episode Scott and Brian discuss their definitions of what it means to be product-centric, and whether this is different to being customer-focused.

<p>00:23 - What does the term product-centric mean?&nbsp;</p>

<p>07:13 - Is there a difference between being product-centric and customer focused?&nbsp;</p>

<p>14:47 - Are nonprofits customer-focused entities?</p>

<p>22:02 - Does product-centric mean putting quality first?&nbsp;</p>

<p>28:23 - How does a disconnect between leadership and teams affect things?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Listen next time when we&rsquo;ll be discussing&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>Brian and Mike talk about how to capture requirements with User Stories.</p>


<p>User Stories are not native to Scrum. We actually borrow the practice from XP. Traditionally, requirements were gathered in huge binders that were very detailed and complex. These were considered complete and were locked down when development began. Teams quickly found that change was a constant and this method of capturing requirements didn&rsquo;t allow for requirements to emerge. Enter User Stories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this episode of the Agile Mentors podcast, Brian Milner and Sherman Gomberg discuss the evolution of one of the Scrum roles: developer. They also explain why self-organizing teams of developers have become critical to all organizations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On agile projects, developers are the people who &ldquo;do the work&rdquo; and while at first glance you may see agile developers as always engineers or other software development professionals, that&rsquo;s not invariably the case. According to the Scrum Guide, the development team can be composed of all kinds of people including designers, writers, programmers, etc.</p>

<p>Using over 25 years of Scrum, agile, and project management experience, Sherman and Brian compare notes on the topic of how to build and sustain agile, self-organizing teams.

        <description>
          <![CDATA[<p>Join Brian Milner and guest co-host Lance Dacy to look at the key capabilities of the product owner, mistakes to avoid, and getting maximum business value from the resources available.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In this episode, Brian Milner and guest co-host Lance Dacy take a detailed look at the role of the product owner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They discuss a common source of confusion about what a product owner is, or does: people try to boil down the role to its tactical processes&mdash;such as writing user stories. The product owner may be accountable for these processes, but providing direction for what the team is trying to accomplish is their forte.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Product owners need to be great communicators and collaborators, with passion for solving problems with their product. Brian and Lance share their experiences of what makes a great product owner, the importance of protecting a team&rsquo;s capacity, and why saying no is often essential to protecting the vision.</p>

<p><strong>Listen now to discover:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>04:10 - What&rsquo;s the difference between a product owner and a product manager?&nbsp;</p>

<p>07:25 - Henrick Kniberg&rsquo;s criteria for successful product owners&nbsp;</p>

<p>08:57 - Why Scrum Masters focus on the how and product owners focus on the why</p>

<p>09:05 - What does &lsquo;being passionate&rsquo; mean to a product owner?&nbsp;</p>

<p>12:48 - The mistake of trying to be too productive as a product owner&nbsp;</p>

<p>19:46 - Can you combine other roles with that of the product owner?&nbsp;</p>

<p>25:55 - What should you find out about a company before accepting a job offer as a product owner?&nbsp;</p>

<p>34:49 - Why one of the most important things you can do is act as a steward of the team&rsquo;s capacity</p>

          <![CDATA[<p>Join Mike Cohn and Brian Milner as they discuss succeeding with agile, including how to choose a framework, the best place to start, &amp; when to break the rules.</p>


<p>In this first episode of the Agile Mentors podcast, Brian Milner and Mike Cohn explain why it&rsquo;s important to understand and sometimes break the rules if you want to succeed with an agile approach like <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum">Scrum</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the Scrum Guide states that the rules are &lsquo;immutable,&rsquo; clinging to the rulebook mindlessly only holds you back. Instead, you need to know which rules Scrum teams can flex (and when), and which agile principles should always be adhered to.<br />
<br />
Brian and Mike share their real-world experience of team members getting things right and wrong, and how you can improve your chances of making long-lasting change as you move to agile.</p>

<p><strong>Listen now to discover:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>05:12 - Why people still confuse the <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/new-to-agile-or-scrum">terms agile and Scrum</a><br />
9:01 -&nbsp;How moving to Scrum changed (and improved) Mike&rsquo;s traditional management style&nbsp;<br />
10:51 - Which rules are OK to break, and how to know when to break them<br />
13:51 - The <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum">daily scrum</a> has to be conducted left to right&hellip;doesn&rsquo;t it?<br />
17:38 - An agile culture or agile practices? Which do you adopt first for a successful agile transformation?<br />
22:19 - What do people need to get right for an agile transition?<br />
24:15 - Does continuous improvement mean cross-functional teams are worked to death? (And a fight breaks out on LinkedIn)<br />
30:03 - Of all the methodologies and agile frameworks you can choose (Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, extreme programming, etc) which one should you start with?</p>

<p><strong>Listen next time when we&rsquo;ll be discussing&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>The history of the Scrum Master role, its connection to project management, and tips to succeed in this vital Scrum role.&nbsp;</p>
